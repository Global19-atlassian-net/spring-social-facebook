This is a fork of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-social-facebook turned into a maven repo specifically for the purpose of keeping at least the login functionality working with the Facebook Graph API 2.10.

To build the artifact and publish it to the mvn-repo branch do: 

 git clone git://github.com/SpringSource/spring-social-facebook.git
 cd spring-social-facebook
 ./gradlew build
 ./gradlew gitPublishPush -Dorg.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username=<GIT_USER> -Dorg.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password=<GIT_SSH_KEY>
 
 If you get any error, add the flag  **--stacktrace**
